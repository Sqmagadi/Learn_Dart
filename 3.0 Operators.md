# Operators In Dart
Operators are used to perform mathematical and logical operations on the variables. Each operation in dart uses a symbol called the operator to denote the type of operation it performs.

- Operands : It represents the data.
- Operator : It represents how the operands will be processed to produce a value.

Note: Suppose the given expression is 2 + 3. Here 2 and 3 are operands, and + is the operator.

### Types Of Operators

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Increment and Decrement Operators
3. Assignment Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Type Test Operators
6. Arithmetic Operators
7. Arithmetic operators are the most common types of operators. They perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

| Operator Symbol | Operator Name | Description|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| +	| Addition	| For adding two operands |
| -	| Subtraction	| For subtracting two operands |
| -expr	| Unary Minus	| For reversing the sign of the expression |
| *	| Multiplication | For multiplying two operands |
| /	| Division	| For dividing two operands and give output in double |
| ~/ | Integer Division	| For dividing two operands and give output in integer |
| %	| Modulus | Remainder After Integer Division |

Let’s look at how to perform arithmetic calculations in dart.

```
void main() {
 // declaring two numbers 
 int num1=10;
 int num2=3;
 
 // performing arithmetic calculation
 int sum=num1+num2;       // addition
 int diff=num1-num2;      // subtraction
 int unaryMinus = -num1;    // unary minus  
 int mul=num1*num2;       // multiplication
 double div=num1/num2;    // division
 int div2 =num1~/num2;     // integer division
 int mod=num1%num2;       // show remainder
 
//Printing info 
 print("The addition is $sum.");
 print("The subtraction is $diff.");
 print("The unary minus is $unaryMinus.");
 print("The multiplication is $mul.");
 print("The division is $div.");
 print("The integer division is $div2.");
 print("The modulus is $mod."); 
}
```

**Output**


### 1. Increment and Decrement Operators

With increment and decrement operators, you can increase and decrease values. If ++ is used at the beginning, then it is a prefix. If it is used at last, then it is postfix.

| Operator Symbol |	Operator Name |	Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|++var	| Pre Increment | Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var+1 |
|--var	| Pre Decrement | Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var-1 |
|var++	| Post Increment | Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 Expression value is var |
|var--	| Post Decrement | Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 Expression value is var |


Note: **++var** increases the value of operands, whereas **var++** returns the actual value of operands before the increment.

```
void main() {
// declaring two numbers 
 int num1=0;
 int num2=0;
 
// performing increment / decrement operator  

// pre increment   
num2 = ++num1;
print("The value of num2 is $num2");

// reset value to 0 
num1 = 0;
num2 = 0;

// post increment  
num2 =  num1++;
print("The value of num2 is $num2");  
  
}
```

**Output**


## 2. Assignment Operators
It is used to assign some values to variables. Here, we are assigning 24 to the age variable.

`int age = 24;`

| Operator Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| = | Assign a value to a variable |
| += | Adds a value to a variable |
| -= | Reduces a value to a variable |
| *= | Multiply value to a variable |
| /= | Divided value by a variable |

```
void main() {
  double age = 24;
  age+= 1;  // Here age+=1 means age = age + 1.
  print("After Addition Age is $age");
  age-= 1;  //Here age-=1 means age = age - 1.
  print("After Subtraction Age is $age");
  age*= 2;  //Here age*=2 means age = age * 2.
  print("After Multiplication Age is $age");
  age/= 2;  //Here age/=2 means age = age / 2.
  print("After Division Age is $age");
}
```

**Output**


## 3. Relational Operators
Relational operators are also called comparison operators. They are used to make a comparison.

| Operator Symbol |	Operator Name |	Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| > | Greater than | Used to check which operand is bigger and gives result as boolean |
| < | Less than	| Used to check which operand is smaller and gives result as boolean |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | Used to check which operand is bigger or equal and gives result as boolean |
| <= | Less than or equal to | Used to check which operand is smaller or equal and gives result as boolean |
| == | Equal to	| Used to check operands are equal to each other and gives result as boolean |
| != | Not equal to | Used to check operand are not equal to each other and gives result as boolean |


```
void main() {
  
 int num1=10;
 int num2=5;
 //printing info
 print(num1==num2); 
 print(num1<num2);
 print(num1>num2);
 print(num1<=num2);
 print(num1>=num2);
};
```

**Output**


## 4. Logical Operators
It is used to compare values.

| Operator Type |	Description |
| --- | --- |
| && |	This is ‘and’, return true if all conditions are true |
| || |	This is ‘or’. Return true if one of the conditions is true |
| !	| This is ’not’. return false if the result is true and vice versa |


```
void main(){
  int userid = 123;
    int userpin = 456;

    // Printing Info
    print((userid == 123) && (userpin== 456)); // print true
    print((userid == 1213) && (userpin== 456)); // print false.
    print((userid == 123) || (userpin== 456)); // print true.
    print((userid == 1213) || (userpin== 456)); // print true
    print((userid == 123) != (userpin== 456));//print false

}
```

**Output**

## 5. Type Test Operators
In Dart, type test operators are useful for checking types at runtime.

| Operator Symbol |	Operator Name |	Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is |	is	| Gives boolean value true if the object has a specific type |
| is! |	is not	| Gives boolean value false if the object has a specific type |

```
void main() {
  String value1 = "Dart Tutorial";
  int age = 10;
  
  print(value1 is String);
  print(age is !int);
}
```

**Output**


### User Input In Dart
Instead of writing hard-coded values, you can give input to the computer. It will make your program more dynamic. You must import the package import 'dart:io'; for user input.


Note: You won’t be able to take input from users using dartpad. You need to run a program from your computer.

#### String User Input
They are used for storing textual user input. If you want to keep values like somebody’s name, address, description, etc., you can take string input from the user.

```
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print("Enter name:");
  String? name  = stdin.readLineSync();
  print("The entered name is ${name}");
}
```

**Output**


#### Integer User Input

You can take integer input to get a numeric value from the user without the decimal point. E.g. 10, 100, -800 etc.

```
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print("Enter number:");
  int? number = int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  print("The entered number is ${number}");
}
```

**Output**


#### Floating Point User Input
You can use float input if you want to get a numeric value from the user with the decimal point. E.g. 10.5, 100.5, -800.9 etc.

```
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  print("Enter a floating number:");
  double number = double.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
  print("The entered num is $number");
}
```

**Output**
