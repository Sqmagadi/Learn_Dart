# Dart
Dart is an open-source, client-optimized, object-oriented programming language built by google to build apps fast for many platforms like android, iOS, web, desktop, etc. Dart is a strongly typed language, which means that the compiler will detect any errors in the code before the code is compiled.

## Dart Features
- Free and open-source.
- Object-oriented programming language.
- Used to develop android, iOS, web, and desktop apps fast.

- You can even use Dart for servers and backend.


### Code Editor 
The best code editor is VS Code if you want to run the dart program from a computer or laptop. You can download the dart extension from VS Code and start coding. 

You can also use other code editors such as **intelij**

For practice you can use **Dartpad**

# Basic Dart Program

```
void main() { 
   print("Hello World!"); 
}
``` 
- This is a simple dart program that prints *Hello World* on screen.
- void main() is the starting point where the execution of your program begins.
- Every program starts with a main function.
- The curly braces {} represent the beginning and the ending of a block of code.
- print(“Hello World!”); prints Hello World! on screen.
- Each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).
