# Steps To Create Dart Project

1. Create a new folder for your dart project and open the folder location on command prompt/terminal.

ie. `cd Desktop/DartProject` 

2. Type `dart create project_name`. Give a project_name of your choice. ie. `dart create myproject`
3. Change directory into the project directory, `cd myproject`
4. Type `code .` to open project with visual studio code
5. To check the main dart file go to `bin/first_app.dar`t and edit your code.

6. Write the Program

```
void main() { 
   print("Hello World!"); 
}
```

- This is a simple dart program that prints *Hello World* on screen.
- **void main()** is the starting point where the execution of your program begins.
- Every program starts with a **main** function.
- The curly braces **{}** represent the beginning and the ending of a block of code.
- **print(“Hello World!”);** prints Hello World! on screen.
- Each code statement must end with a semicolon (**;**).


7. Run Dart Project
First, open the project location on the command/terminal and run the project with this command.

`dart run`


## Dart app (single file)
You can also just create a single dart file without creating an entire dart project. That is for practice and you must also manage all dart modules by yourself.

- Open your code editor and create a file with `.dart` extension 

`hello.dart`

- Write the program

```
void main(){
    print ("Hello World");
}
```

- Run the program

Open the terminal. Ensure you are in the same directory as your dart file `hello.dart`

run the command: `dart hello.dart`

**Output**

`Hello World`
