# String
String helps you to store `text` data. You can store values like `I love dart`, `New York 2140` in String. You can use single or double quotes to store string in dart.

```
void main() {
// Declaring Values     
String schoolName = "Bell Hills Academy";
String address = "Palm Island";   

// Printing Values
print("School name is $schoolName and address is $address");   
}
```

**Output**

`School name is Bell Hills Academy and address is Palm Island`

#### Create A Multi-Line String In Dart
If you want to create a multi-line String in dart, then you can use `triple quotes` with either single or double quotation marks.

```
void main() {
// Multi Line Using Single Quotes   
String multiLineText = '''
This is Multi Line Text
with 3 single quote
I am also writing here.
''';
   
// Multi Line Using Double Quotes   
String otherMultiLineText = """
This is Multi Line Text
with 3 double quote
I am also writing here.
""";
   
// Printing Information   
print("Multiline text is $multiLineText");
print("Other multiline text is $otherMultiLineText");
} 
```

**Output**

```
Multiline text is This is Multi Line Text
with 3 single quote
I am also writing here.

Other multiline text is This is Multi Line Text
with 3 double quote
I am also writing here.
```

#### Special Character In String
| Special Character	| Work |
| ----- | ----- |
| \n |	New Line |
| \t |	Tab |


```
void main() {
   
// Using \n and \t   
print("I am from \nUS.");
print("I am from \tUS.");
}
```

**Output**

```
I am from 
US.
I am from 	US.
```

#### Create A Raw String In Dart
You can also create raw string in dart. Special characters won’t work here. You must write r after equal sign.

```
void main() {
// Set price value
num price = 10;
String withoutRawString = "The value of price is \t $price"; // regular String
String withRawString =r"The value of price is \t $price"; // raw String

print("Without Raw: $withoutRawString"); // regular result
print("With Raw: $withRawString"); // with raw result

}
```

**Output**

```
Without Raw: The value of price is 	 10
With Raw: The value of price is \t $price
```


String helps you to store text based data. In String, you can represent your name, address, or complete book. It holds a series or sequence of characters – letters, numbers, and special characters. You can use single or double, or triple quotes to represent String.


Single line String is written in single or double quotes, whereas multi-line strings are written in triple quotes. Here is an example of it:

```
void main() {   
   String text1 = 'This is an example of a single-line string.';   
   String text2 = "This is an example of a single line string using double quotes.";   
   String text3 = """This is a multiline line   
string using the triple-quotes.
This is tutorial on dart strings.
""";   
   print(text1);  
   print(text2);   
   print(text3);   
}
```

**Output**

```
This is an example of a single-line string.

This is an example of a single line string using double quotes.

This is a multiline line   
string using the triple-quotes.
This is tutorial on dart strings.
```

### String Concatenation

You can combine one String with another string. This is called concatenation. In Dart, you can use the + operator or use interpolation to concatenate the String. Interpolation makes it easy to read and understand the code.

```
void main() {   
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
print("Using +, Full Name is "+firstName + " " + lastName+".");
print("Using interpolation, full name is $firstName $lastName.");  
  
}
```

**Output**

```
Using +, Full Name  is John Doe.

Using interpolation, full name is John Doe.
```

### Properties Of String

1. `codeUnits`: Returns an unmodifiable list of the UTF-16 code units of this string.
2. `isEmpty`: Returns true if this string is empty.
3. `isNotEmpty`: Returns false if this string is empty.
4. `length`: Returns the length of the string including space, tab, and newline characters.

```
void main() {
   String str = "Hi";
   print(str.codeUnits);   //Example of code units
   print(str.isEmpty);     //Example of isEmpty
   print(str.isNotEmpty);  //Example of isNotEmpty
   print("The length of the string is: ${str.length}");   //Example of Length
}
```

**Output**

```
[72, 105]
false
true
The length of the String is: 2
```

### Methods Of String

1. `toLowerCase()`: Converts all characters in this string to lowercase.
2. `toUpperCase()`: Converts all characters in this string to uppercase.
3. `trim()`: Returns the string without any leading and trailing whitespace.
4. `compareTo()`: Compares this object to another.
5. `replaceAll()`: Replaces all substrings that match the specified pattern with a given value.
6. `split()`: Splits the string at matches of the specified delimiter and returns a list of substrings.
7. `toString()`: Returns a string representation of this object.
8. `substring()`: Returns the text from any position you want.
9. `codeUnitAt()`: Returns the 16-bit UTF-16 code unit at the given index.

**String Methods Example In Dart**


1. Converting String To Uppercase and Lowercase
You can convert your text to lower case using `.toLowerCase()` and convert to uppercase using `.toUpperCase()` method.

```
//Example of toUpperCase() and toLowerCase()
void main() { 
   String address1 = "Florida"; // Here F is capital
   String address2 = "TexAs"; // Here T and A are capital
   print("Address 1 in uppercase: ${address1.toUpperCase()}"); 
   print("Address 1 in lowercase: ${address1.toLowerCase()}"); 
   print("Address 2 in uppercase: ${address2.toUpperCase()}"); 
   print("Address 2 in lowercase: ${address2.toLowerCase()}"); 
}
```

**Output**

2. Trim String In Dart

Trim is helpful when removing leading and trailing spaces from the text. This trim method will remove all the starting and ending spaces from the text. You can also use `trimLeft()` and `trimRight()` methods to remove space from left and right, respectively.


Note: The `trim()` method in Dart doesn’t remove spaces in the middle.

```
//Example of trim()
void main() { 
  String address1 = " USA"; // Contain space at leading.
  String address2 = "Japan  "; // Contain space at trailing. 
  String address3 = "New Delhi"; // Contains space at middle.
  
  print("Result of address1 trim is ${address1.trim()}");
  print("Result of address2 trim is ${address2.trim()}");
  print("Result of address3 trim is ${address3.trim()}");
  print("Result of address1 trimLeft is ${address1.trimLeft()}");
  print("Result of address2 trimRight is ${address2.trimRight()}");
}
```

**Output**

3. Compare String In Dart

In Dart, you can compare two strings. It will give the result 0 when two texts are equal, 1 when the first String is greater than the second, and -1 when the first String is smaller than the second.

```
//Example of compareTo()
void main() { 
   String item1 = "Apple"; 
   String item2 = "Ant"; 
   String item3 = "Basket"; 
   
   print("Comparing item 1 with item 2: ${item1.compareTo(item2)}"); 
   print("Comparing item 1 with item 3: ${item1.compareTo(item3)}"); 
   print("Comparing item 3 with item 2: ${item3.compareTo(item2)}"); 
} 
```

**Output**


4. Replace String In Dart
You can replace one value with another with the replaceAll(“old”, “new”) method in Dart. It will replace all the “old” words with “new”. Here in this example, this will replace milk with water.

```
//Example of replaceAll()
void main() { 
String text = "I am a good boy I like milk. Doctor says milk is good for health.";
  
String newText = text.replaceAll("milk", "water"); 
 
print("Original Text: $text");
print("Replaced Text: $newText");  
   
} 
```

**Output**


5. Split String In Dart
You can use the dart split method if you want to split String by comma, space, or other text. It will help you to split String to list.

```
//Example of split()
void main() { 
  String allNames = "Ram, Hari, Shyam, Gopal";

  List<String> listNames = allNames.split(",");
  print("Value of listName is $listNames");

  print("List name at 0 index ${listNames[0]}");
  print("List name at 1 index ${listNames[1]}");
  print("List name at 2 index ${listNames[2]}");
  print("List name at 3 index ${listNames[3]}");
   
} 
```
**Output**


6. ToString In Dart

In dart, toString() represents String representation of the value/object.

```
//Example of toString()
void main() { 
int number = 20;     
String result = number.toString(); 
  
print("Type of number is ${number.runtimeType}");  
print("Type of result is ${result.runtimeType}");  
    
} 
```  


**Output**


7. SubString In Dart
You can use substring in Dart when you want to get a text from any position.

```
//Example of substring()
void main() { 
   String text = "I love computer"; 
   print("Print only computer: ${text.substring(7)}"); // from index 6 to the last index 
   print("Print only love: ${text.substring(2,6)}");// from index 2 to the 6th index 
} 
```

**Output**

8. Reverse String In Dart
If you want to reverse a String in Dart, you can reverse it using a different solution. One solution is here.

```
void main() { 
  String input = "Hello"; 
  print("$input Reverse is ${input.split('').reversed.join()}"); 
} 
```

**Output**

9. How To Capitalize First Letter Of String In Dart
If you want to capitalize the first letter of a String in Dart, you can use the following code.

```
//Example of capitalize first letter of String
void main() { 
  String text = "hello world"; 
  print("Capitalized first letter of String: ${text[0].toUpperCase()}${text.substring(1)}"); 
} 
```
