# Lists

The list holds multiple values in a single variable. It is also called arrays. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.



**Lists can be classified as −**

1. Fixed Length List
2. Growable List
Let us now discuss these two types of lists in detail.

#### 1. Fixed Length List
A fixed length list’s length cannot change at runtime. The syntax for creating a fixed length list is as given below −

**Step 1 − Declaring a list**



`var list_name = new List(initial_size)`

The above syntax creates a list of the specified size. The list cannot grow or shrink at runtime. Any attempt to resize the list will result in an exception.

`Step 2 − Initializing a list`

```
lst_name[index] = value;
Example
Live Demo
void main() { 
   var lst = new List(3); 
   lst[0] = 12; 
   lst[1] = 13; 
   lst[2] = 11; 
   print(lst); 
}
```

**Output**

`[12, 13, 11]`

#### 2. Growable List
A growable list’s length can change at run-time. The syntax for declaring and initializing a growable list is as given below −

**Step 1 − Declaring a List**

`var list_name = [val1,val2,val3]   `

--- creates a list containing the specified values  

OR  

`var list_name = new List() `

--- creates a list of size zero 

**Step 2 − Initializing a List**

The index / subscript is used to reference the element that should be populated with a value.

`list_name[index] = value;`

*Example*

The following example shows how to create a list of 3 elements.

```
void main() { 
   var num_list = [1,2,3]; 
   print(num_list); 
}
```

**Output**

`[1, 2, 3]`

**Example**

The following example creates a zero-length list using the empty List() constructor. The add() function in the List class is used to dynamically add elements to the list.

```
void main() { 
   var lst = new List(); 
   lst.add(12); 
   lst.add(13); 
   print(lst); 
} 
```

**Output**

`[12, 13] `

**List Properties**

The following table lists some commonly used properties of the List class in the dart:core library.

|Method |Description|
|---|---|
|first |Returns the first element in the list.|

|isEmpty |Returns true if the collection has no elements.|

|isNotEmpty |Returns true if the collection has at least one element.|

|length |Returns the size of the list.|

|last |Returns the last element in the list.|

|reversed |Returns an iterable object containing the lists values in the reverse order.|

|Single |Checks if the list has only one element and returns it.|


**Example**

```
void main() {
List<String> names = ["Raj", "John", "Max"];
print("Value of names is $names");
print("Value of names[0] is ${names[0]}"); // index 0
print("Value of names[1] is ${names[1]}"); // index 1
print("Value of names[2] is ${names[2]}"); // index 2

  // Finding Length of List 
int length = names.length;  
print("The Length of names is $length");
}
```

**Output**

```
Value of names is [Raj, John, Max]
Value of names[0] is Raj
Value of names[1] is John
Value of names[2] is Max
The Length of names is 3
```

Note: List index always starts with 0. Here names[0] is Raj, names[1] is John and names[2] is Max.


### Basic Operations

In this chapter, we will discuss how to carry out some basic operations on Lists.


**1. Inserting Elements into a List**

Mutable Lists can grow dynamically at runtime. The `List.add()` function appends the specified value to the end of the List and returns a modified List object.

**2.	Updating a list**

Lists in Dart can be updated by −

- Updating The Index
- Using the `List.replaceRange()` function

**3.	Removing List items**

The following functions supported by the List class in the dart:core library can be used to remove the item(s) in a List.

`list.remove()`
