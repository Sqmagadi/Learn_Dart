# Lists

The list holds multiple values in a single variable. It is also called arrays. If you want to store multiple values without creating multiple variables, you can use a list.

```
void main() {
List<String> names = ["Raj", "John", "Max"];
print("Value of names is $names");
print("Value of names[0] is ${names[0]}"); // index 0
print("Value of names[1] is ${names[1]}"); // index 1
print("Value of names[2] is ${names[2]}"); // index 2

  // Finding Length of List 
int length = names.length;  
print("The Length of names is $length");
}
```

**Output**

```
Value of names is [Raj, John, Max]
Value of names[0] is Raj
Value of names[1] is John
Value of names[2] is Max
The Length of names is 3
```

Note: List index always starts with 0. Here names[0] is Raj, names[1] is John and names[2] is Max.
