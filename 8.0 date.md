# DATETIME IN DART

Date and time are often used in our day-to-day activities. As a programmer you need to know how to find a date and time? How to format date? and how to perform different calculation in date?

**How To Get Date And Time**
Use the following code to get the current date and time in the dart.

```
void main() {
  print(DateTime.now());
}
```

Get Year, Month, Day Of Datetime In Dart

Here is the way to get a year, month, day, hour, minutes, and seconds in Dart. You can convert DateTime to String by using the toString() method.

**Example**

```
void main() {
  DateTime datetime = DateTime.now();
  print("Year is " + datetime.year.toString());
  print("Month is " + datetime.month.toString());
  print("Day is ${datetime.day}"); // If you don't want to use .toString
  print("Hour is " + datetime.hour.toString());
  print("Minutes is " + datetime.minute.toString());
  print("Second is " + datetime.second.toString());
}
```

**How To Convert Datetime To String In Dart**

Use the following code to convert DateTime to String in the dart.

```
void main() {
  String datetime = DateTime.now().toString();
  print(datetime);
}
```

**How To Convert String To DateTime**

You cannot get year, months, or day directly and cannot perform date calculation using a String if that String contains the correct DateTime value. In such a situation, you first need to convert String to DateTime.

```
void main() {
  String myDateInString = "2022-05-01";
  DateTime myConvertedDate = DateTime.parse(myDateInString);
  print("Year is " + myConvertedDate.year.toString());
  print("Month is " + myConvertedDate.month.toString());
  print("Day is " + myConvertedDate.day.toString());
}
```

**Methods Supported By Datetime In Dart**

You can use DateTime methods if you want to add days, hours, or minutes to DateTime. Let us suppose you have created a DateTime object named mybirthday. DateTime mybirthday = DateTime.parse("1997-05-14");

| Method |	Example |
| --- | --- |
| add(Duration) |	myBirthday.add(Duration(days: 1)); |
| subtract(Duration) |	myBirthday.subtract(Duration(days: 1)); |


> Note: You can set a duration to days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, and microseconds. To understand it more, look at the example below.

*Example: Add Date In Dart*

```
void main() {
  DateTime myBirthday = DateTime.parse("1997-05-14");
  myBirthday = myBirthday.add(Duration(days: 1));
  print("Year is " + myBirthday.year.toString());
  print("Month is " + myBirthday.month.toString());
  print("Day is " + myBirthday.day.toString());
}
```

*Example: Subtract Date In Dart*

```
void main() {
  DateTime myBirthday = DateTime.parse("1997-05-14");
  myBirthday = myBirthday.subtract(Duration(days: 1));
  print("Year is " + myBirthday.year.toString());
  print("Month is " + myBirthday.month.toString());
  print("Day is " + myBirthday.day.toString());
}
```

**Find Difference Between Two Dates In Dart**

Suppose you want to find the difference between two dates in dart. There is a straightforward way.

```
void main() {
  DateTime myBirthday = DateTime.parse("1997-05-14");
  DateTime today = DateTime.now();
  Duration diff = today.difference(myBirthday);
  print("Difference in days: " + diff.inDays.toString());
  print("Difference in hours: " + diff.inHours.toString());
  print("Difference in minutes: " + diff.inMinutes.toString());
  print("Difference in seconds: " + diff.inSeconds.toString());
  print("Difference in milliseconds: " + diff.inMilliseconds.toString());
  print("Difference in microseconds: " + diff.inMicroseconds.toString());
}
```

| Name |	Description |
| --- | --- | 
| inDays |	Convert duration in days. |
| inHours |	Convert duration in hours. |
| inMinutes |	Convert duration in minutes. |
| inSeconds	| Convert duration in seconds. |
| inMilliseconds |	Convert duration in milli seconds. |
| inMicroseconds |	Convert duration in micro seconds. |


**DateTime Comparision Methods**

If you want to compare two dates, then you can use comparison methods.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| IsAfter(DateTime) |	Returns true or false. bool |
| IsBefore(DateTime) |	Returns true or false. bool |
| IsAtTheSameMoment(DateTime) |	Returns true or false. bool |

```
void main() {
  DateTime myBirthday = DateTime.parse("1997-05-14");
  DateTime today = DateTime.now();

  if (myBirthday.isBefore(today)) {
    print("My Birthday is before today.");
  } else if (myBirthday.isAfter(today)) {
    print("My Birthday is after today.");
  } else if (myBirthday.isAtSameMomentAs(today)) {
    print("My Birthday date and today's date is same.");
  }
}
```
