# VARIABLES IN DART

Variables are containers used to store value in a program. There are different types of variables where you can keep different kinds of values. 

*Example*

```
// here variable name contains value John.
var name = "John"; 
```


### Variable Types

1. **String**: For storing text value. E.g. “John”, "My name is Paul" [Must be in quotes]
2. **int**: For storing integer value. ie. 10, -10, 105 [Decimal is not included]
3. **double**: For storing float values. ie. 10.0, -10.5, 100.009 [Decimal is included]
4. **num**: For storing any type of number. ie. 1, 5.2, -2 [both int and double]
5. **bool**: For storing true or false. ie. true, false [Only stores true or false values]
6. **var**: For storing any value. ie. Paul, 12, ‘z’, true

### Syntax

`type variableName = value;`

*Examples*

```
void main() {
// declaring variables
String name = "John";
String address = "USA";  
num age = 20; // used to store any types of numbers 
num height = 5.9;
bool isMarried = false;
```

*Using the variables*

To use the variables decleared like above, we call the variable name with a `$` sign like bellow: 

``` 
// printing variables value   
print("Name is $name");
print("Address is $address");
print("Age is $age");
print("Height is $height");
print("Married Status is $isMarried");
}
```

**Output**

**`Var` key word**

Even in type-safe Dart code, you can declare most variables without explicitly specifying their type using var. Thanks to type inference, these variables' types are determined by their initial values:

```
var name = 'Voyager I';
var year = 1977;
var antennaDiameter = 3.7;
var flybyObjects = ['Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'];
var image = {
  'tags': ['saturn'],
  'url': '//path/to/saturn.jpg'
};
```


### Rules For Creating Variables In Dart
- Variable names are case sensitive, i.e., a and A are different.
- A variable name can consist of letters and alphabets.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- Keywords are not allowed to be used as a variable name.
- Blank spaces are not allowed in a variable name.
- Special characters are not allowed except for the underscore (_) and the dollar ($) sign.

### Dart Constant

Constant is the type of variable whose value never changes. In programming, changeable values are mutable and unchangeable values are immutable. Sometimes, you don’t need to change the value once declared. Like the value of PI=3.14, it never changes. To create a constant in Dart, you can use the const keyword.

```
void main(){
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 4.23; // not possible  
print("Value of PI is $pi");
}
```

### Naming Convention For Variables In Dart
It is a good habit to follow the naming convention. In Dart Variables, the variable name should start with lower-case, and every second word’s first letter will be upper-case like num1, fullName, isMarried, etc. Technically, this naming convention is called *lowerCamelCase*.

```
Naming Convention Example
// Not standard way
var fullname = "John Doe";
// Standard way
var fullName = "John Doe";
const pi = 3.14;
```


# Final Vs Const In Dart
If you do not want to change the value of a variable, then you can use either final or const in dart.

**Example**

```
void main() {
  final finalName = "Final John Doe";
  const constName = "Const John Doe";

  finalName = "Raj"; // Not Possible
  constName = "Anu"; // Not Possible

  print("Final name is " + finalName);
  print("Const name is " + constName);
}
```

**Output**

### Const In Dart

If you need to calculate value at compile-time, it is a good idea to choose const over final. A const variable is a compile-time constant. They must be created from data that can be calculated at compile time. `100+1` is valid const expression but const `date = DateTime.now()`; is not.

#### What Is Compile Time
When you run code in the dart, it will be compiled into the format that the machine can understand. This time is called compile time. Const value should be known at compile time.

#### What Is Run Time
Runtime is the time when your compiled code is started running. It generally occurs after the compile time.

> Note: If you use const `inside` the class, declare it as static const.

```
const total = 50+50; // Possible
const date = DateTime.now(); // Not Possible
```

**Advantage Of Constant**

- Improve Performance

### Final In Dart
If the value is calculated at runtime, you can choose final for it.  ie. if you want to calculate date on run time, you can use `final date = DateTime.now();` but not `const date = DateTime.now();`.


> Note: Anything that is unknown at compile time should be final over const.

```
final date = DateTime.now(); // Possible
const date = DateTime.now(); // Not Possible
```

**When To Use Const**

- If you know the value at compile-time, choose const for e.g. const a = 100;.

**When To Use Final**

- If you don’t know the value at compile-time, choose final.
- If you want a network request that can’t be changed, choose final.
- If you want to get some values from the database, choose final.
- If you want to read a local file, choose final.


> Note: Final variables will have a value known at runtime. Const variables have a value known at compile time. Instance variable can be final but not const.
