# Sets
An unordered collection of unique items is called set in dart. You can store unique data in sets.


Note: Set doesnâ€™t print duplicate items.

```
void main() {
Set<String> weekday = {"Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"};
print(weekday);
}
```

**Output**

`{Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat}`
