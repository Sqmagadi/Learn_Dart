# Comments in Dart

Comments are a great way to enhance the readability of your Dart code and make it easier to understand. In Dart, there are two types of comments: **single-line** and **multi-line** comments.

*Single-line Comments*

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). Everything after the two forward slashes is ignored by the compiler. 

```
void main() {
// declaring variables
String name = "John"; 
   
// printing variables value   
print("Name is $name");
}
```

*Multi-line Comments*

Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk (`/*`) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash (`*/`). Anything between the starting and ending delimiters is ignored by the compiler. 

```
void main() {
// declaring variables
String name = "John"; 

/* String address = "Kenya";  
num age = 20; 
num height = 5.9;
bool isMarried = false;  */
   
// printing variables value   
print("Name is $name");
}
```
