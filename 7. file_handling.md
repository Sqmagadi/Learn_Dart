# File Handling in Dart

File handling is an important part of any programming language. 

### Read File In Dart
Assume that you have a file named `test.txt` in the same directory of your dart program.

```
Welcome to test.txt file.
This is a test file.
```

Now, you can read this file using File class and `readAsStringSync()` method.

```
// dart program to read from file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // creating file object
  File file = File('test.txt');
  // read file
  String contents = file.readAsStringSync();
  // print file
  print(contents);
}
```

**Output**


### Get File Information

In this example below, you will learn how to get file information like file location, file size, and last modified time.

```
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('test.txt');
  // get file location
  print('File path: ${file.path}');
  // get absolute path
  print('File absolute path: ${file.absolute.path}');
  // get file size
  print('File size: ${file.lengthSync()} bytes');
  // get last modified time
  print('Last modified: ${file.lastModifiedSync()}');
}
```

**Output**


> Note: If you try to get information of a file that does not exist, then it will throw an exception.


## CSV File

A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file is a plain text file that contains data organized in a table format, where columns are separated by commas and rows are separated by line breaks. CSV files are used for:

- Data exchange between different applications.
- Data backup and restore.
- Importing and exporting data from databases.
- Automation of data processing tasks.

#### Read CSV File In Dart
Assume that you have a CSV file named `test.csv` in the same directory of your dart program.

```
Name,Email,Phone
John, john@gmail.com, 1234567890
Smith, smith@gmail.com, 0987654321
```

Now, you can read this file using File class and `readAsStringSync()` method. We will use `split()` method to split the string into a list of strings.

```
// dart program to read from csv file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('test.csv');
  // read file
  String contents = file.readAsStringSync();
  // split file using new line
  List<String> lines = contents.split('\n');
  // print file
  print('---------------------');
  for (var line in lines) {
    print(line);
  }
}
```

**Output**


### Read Only Part Of File
You can read only part of file using `substring()` method. Here is an example to read only first 10 characters of file. Make sure that you have a file named `test.txt` in the same directory of your dart program.

```
Welcome to test.txt file
This is a test file.
```

```
// dart program to read from file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = new File('test.txt');
  // read only first 10 characters
  String contents = file.readAsStringSync().substring(0, 10);
  // print file
  print(contents);
}
```

**Output**


### Read File From Specific Directory
To read a file from a specific directory, you need to provide the full path of the file. Here is an example to read file from a specific directory.

```
// dart program to read from file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('C:\\Users\\test.txt');
  // read file
  String contents = file.readAsStringSync();
  // print file
  print(contents);
}
```

**Output**


## Write File In Dart
Let’s create a file named test.txt in the same directory of your dart program and write some text in it.

```
// dart program to write to file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('test.txt');
  // write to file
  file.writeAsStringSync('Welcome to test.txt file.');
  print('File written.');
}
```

**Output**



> Note: If you have already some content in test.txt file, then it will be removed and replaced with new content.

#### Add New Content To Previous Content

You can use FileMode.append to add new content to previous content. Assume that test.txt file already contains some text.

```
Welcome to test.txt file.
Now, let’s add new content to it.
```

```
// dart program to write to existing file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file =  File('test.txt');
  // write to file
  file.writeAsStringSync('\nThis is a new content.', mode: FileMode.append);
  print('Congratulations!! New content is added on top of previous content.');
}
```

**Output**


### Write CSV File In Dart

In the example below, we will ask user to enter name and phone of 3 students and write it to a csv file named students.csv.

```
// dart program to write to csv file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File("students.csv");
  // write to file
  file.writeAsStringSync('Name,Phone\n');
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // user input name
    stdout.write("Enter name of student ${i + 1}: ");
    String? name = stdin.readLineSync();
    stdout.write("Enter phone of student ${i + 1}: ");
    // user input phone
    String? phone = stdin.readLineSync();
    file.writeAsStringSync('$name,$phone\n', mode: FileMode.append);
  }
  print("Congratulations!! CSV file written successfully.");
}
```

**Output**


students.csv file will look like this:

```
Name,Phone
John,1234567890
Mark,0123456789
Elon,0122112322
```


> Note: You can create any type of file using writeAsStringSync() method. For example, .html, .json, .xml, etc.

## Delete File In Dart
Assume that you have a file named test.txt in the same directory of your dart program. Now, let’s delete it.

```
// dart program to delete file
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('test.txt');
  // delete file
  file.deleteSync();
  print('File deleted.');
}
```

**Output**



> Note: If you try to delete a file that does not exist, then it will throw an exception.

### Delete File If Exists

You can use File.existsSync() method to check if a file exists or not. If it exists, then you can delete it.

```
// dart program to delete file if exists
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // open file
  File file = File('test.txt');
  // check if file exists
  if (file.existsSync()) {
    // delete file
    file.deleteSync();
    print('File deleted.');
  } else {
    print('File does not exist.');
  }
}
```

**Output**


## Dart File Handling Practice Questions
1. Write a dart program to add your name to “hello.txt” file.
2. Write a dart program to append your friends name to a file that already has your name.
3. Write a dart program to get the current working directory.
4. Write a dart program to copy the “hello.txt” file to “hello_copy.txt” file.
5. Write a dart program to create 100 files using loop.
6. Write a dart program to delete the file “hello_copy.txt”. Make sure you have created the file “hello_copy.txt.
7. Write a dart program to store name, age, and address of students in a csv file and read it.
