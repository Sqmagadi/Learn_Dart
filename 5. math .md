# Math In Dart
Math helps you to perform mathematical calculations efficiently. With dart math, you can generate random number, find square root, find power of number, or round specific numbers. To use math in dart, you must import 'dart:math';.

### How To Generate Random Numbers In Dart
This example shows how to generate random numbers from 0 - 9 and also 1 to 10. After watching this example, you can generate a random number between your choices.

```
import 'dart:math';
void main()
{
Random random = new Random();
int randomNumber = random.nextInt(10); // from 0 to 9 included
print("Generated Random Number Between 0 to 9: $randomNumber");
  
int randomNumber2 = random.nextInt(10)+1; // from 1 to 10 included  
print("Generated Random Number Between 1 to 10: $randomNumber2"); 
}
```

In this program, random.nextInt(10) function is used to generate a random number between 0 and 9 in which the value is stored in a variable randomNumber.

The random.nextInt(10)+1 function is used to generate random number between 1 to 10 in which the value is stored in a variable randomNumber2.

**Generate Random Number Between Any Number**

Use this formula to generate a random number between any numbers in the dart.

> min + Random().nextInt((max + 1) - min);

*Example: Random Number In Dart Between 10 - 20*

This program generates random numbers between 10 to 20.

```
import 'dart:math';
void main()
{

int min = 10;
int max = 20; 

int randomnum = min + Random().nextInt((max + 1) - min);
  
print("Generated Random number between $min and $max is: $randomnum");  
}
```


**Output**

**Random Boolean And Double Value**

Here you will learn how to generate random boolean and double values in dart.

  >Random().nextBool(); // return true or false
  >Random().nextDouble(); // return 0.0 to 1.0

*Example 1: Generate Random Boolean And Double Values*

This example below generate random and boolean value.

```
import 'dart:math';
void main()
{
double randomDouble = Random().nextDouble();
bool randomBool = Random().nextBool();
  
print("Generated Random double value is: $randomDouble");  
print("Generated Random bool value is: $randomBool");  
}
```


*Example 2: Generate a List Of Random Numbers In Dart*

This example will generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 to 100.

```
import 'dart:math';
void main()
{
List<int> randomList = List.generate(10, (_) => Random().nextInt(100)+1); 
print(randomList);  
}
```

**Useful Math Function In Dart**

| Function Name	| Output |	Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pow(10,2) |	100	| 10 to the power 2 is 10*10 |
| max(10,2) |	10	| Maximum number is 10 |
| min(10,2) |	2	| Minimum number is 2 |
| sqrt(25) |	5	| Square root of 25 is 5 |

*Example: Math In Dart*

This example below finds the power of a number, a minimum and maximum value between two numbers, and the square root of a number.

```
import 'dart:math';
void main()
{
  int num1 = 10;
  int num2 = 2;

  num powernum = pow(num1,num2);
  num maxnum = max(num1,num2);
  num minnum = min(num1,num2);
  num squareroot = sqrt(25); // Square root of 25
  
  print("Power is $powernum"); 
  print("Maximum is $maxnum"); 
  print("Minimum is $minnum"); 
  print("Square root is $squareroot"); 
  
}
```

**Output**


In this program, pow(num1, num2) is a function where num1 is a digit and num2 is a power.

max(num1,num2) is a function which give the maximum number between num1 and num2.

min(num1,num2) is a function which give the mininum number between num1 and num2.

sqrt(25) is a function that gives the square root of 25.
