# Dart
Dart is an open-source, client-optimized, object-oriented programming language built by google for building  apps for platforms like mobile(android, iOS), web, and desktop. Dart is a strongly typed language, which means that the compiler will detect any errors in the code before the code is compiled.

The Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the **Dart VM**. The SDK also includes a utility -**dart2js**, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script.

## Dart Features
- Free and open-source.
- Object-oriented programming language.
- Used to develop android, iOS, web, and desktop apps fast.
- Can compile to either native code or javascript.
- Offers modern programming features like null safety and asynchronous programming.
- You can even use Dart for servers and backend.


### Code Editor 
The best code editor is VS Code if you want to run the dart program from a computer or laptop. You can download the dart extension from VS Code and start coding. 

You can also use other code editors and IDEs such as **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, and **WebStorm**

For practice you can use **Dartpad** which is an online editor.

### Dart History
- Google developed Dart in 2011 as an alternative to javascript.
- Dart 1.0 was released on November 14, 2013.
- Dart 2.0 was released in August 2018.
- Dart 3.0 was released in May 2023.
- Dart gained popularity in recent days because of flutter.


# Basic Dart Program

```
void main() { 
   print("Hello World!"); 
}
```

- This is a simple dart program that prints *Hello World* on screen.
- **void main()** is the starting point where the execution of your program begins.
- Every program starts with a **main** function.
- The curly braces **{}** represent the beginning and the ending of a block of code.
- **print(“Hello World!”);** prints Hello World! on screen.
- Each code statement must end with a semicolon (**;**).


Every app requires the top-level `main()` function, where execution starts. Functions that don't explicitly return a value have the `void` return type. To display text on the console, you can use the top-level `print()` function:
