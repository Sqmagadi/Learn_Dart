# How To Check Runtime Type
You can check runtime type in dart with .runtimeType after the variable name.

```
void main() { 
   var a = 10;
   print(a.runtimeType); 
   print(a is int); // true
}
```

**Output**

```
int
true
```

## Optionally Typed Language
You may have heard of the statically-typed language. It means the data type of variables is known at compile time. Similarly, dynamically-typed language means data types of variables are known at run time. Dart supports dynamic and static types, so it is called optionally-typed language.

## Statically Typed
A language is statically typed if the data type of variables is known at compile time. Its main advantage is that the compiler can quickly check the issues and detect bugs.

```
void main() { 
   var myVariable = 50; // You can also use int instead of var
   myVariable = "Hello"; // this will give error
   print(myVariable);
}
```

**Output**

```
Error:
A value of type 'String' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'int'.
```

## Dynamically Typed Example
A language is dynamically typed if the data type of variables is known at run time.

```
void main() { 
   dynamic myVariable = 50;
   myVariable = "Hello";
   print(myVariable);
}
```

**Output**

`Hello`

Note: Using static type helps you to prevent writing silly mistakes in code. Itâ€™s a good habit to use static type in dart.
